# Altcoint-Exchanges-Repository
A smart contract with the purpose of improving the transactions of altcoins in the exchanges and calculate an accurate price of the altcoin.

Note: attempt to enhance the ERC20 protocol to store the value of the coins inside the smart contract itself. I stopped working on this project due to the lack of interest in the Smart Contract technology.
